Open terminal for each command and execute the following:

`$ chmod +x *`

`$ ./run.sh`

`$ java MyServer`

`$ java Writer`

`$ java Reader`  <br />

For Reader it will be prompted with id, for one command give the id as 1 and for the second reader give the id as 2.
Now you can use the phrases like "pause", "resume" and "stop" for the reader.
